### What you can expect

Compared to tightly scheduled scientific conferences, the workshop has its main emphasis on active discussion and exchange between the participants. We encourage participants not only to question or defend their methods, but also to think about new ideas and perspectives related to their work.

To get into this discussion, we will organize poster sessions. Therefore, we ask you to bring a poster to the workshop, where you can pitch your research to the other participants and have a lively discussion. We encourage you to also present your work-in-progress and potential challenges you are facing.

The official workshop language is English.

### How to register

Please send your name, e-mail address, institution and research topic to [hydmod25@gfz.de](mailto:hydmod25@gfz.de). The application deadline is Friday 6th of June, 2025. Applicants will be notified about acceptance by June 13, 2025. 

The maximum number of participants is 26 and in case of more applicants the selection criteria are diversity of institution and research fields, as well as gender balance.

### Excursion

The last day of the workshop event, participants are invited to join the excursion with the research project [CHARMANT](https://www.charmant-grundwasser.de/) (in German language only), focused on sustainable use of groundwater resources in urban areas, in Berlin.

We highly encourage active participation to discuss the importance of the work and methods used, as well as other projects and initiatives around the topics of our workshop. 

More details on the event will be shared with the confirmed participants.
